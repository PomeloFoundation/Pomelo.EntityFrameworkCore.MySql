      Specify the absolute path to the EntityFrameworkCore base directory,
      to compile against that version for better development and local
      debugging support.

      Rename this file "development.props".

      The EFCore assemblies are being compiled with an AssemblyVersion of
      "42.42.42.42" by default. To not get any compilation errors
      for the EFCore.MySql.IntegrationTests project, which uses
      Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore, which references
      it's own version of EFCore, you have to make sure, that your local
      EFCore assemblies are compiled with an AssemblyVersion <= the one
      referenced by Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore
      (e.g. "3.1.0.0").

      To achive that, run the following command in your EntityFrameworkCore
      base directory:

      dotnet build "/p:AssemblyVersion=3.1.0.0"
    -->
    <LocalEFCoreRepository>C:\Repositories\EntityFrameworkCore</LocalEFCoreRepository>
    <LocalMySqlConnectorRepository>C:\Repositories\MySqlConnector</LocalMySqlConnectorRepository>
  </PropertyGroup>
