			"Content": "MySQLMySQL is written in C and C++. Its SQL parser is written in yacc, but it uses a home-brewed lexical analyzer.[17] MySQL works on many system platforms, including AIX, BSDi, FreeBSD, HP-UX, eComStation, i5/OS, IRIX, Linux, OS X, Microsoft Windows, NetBSD, Novell NetWare, OpenBSD, OpenSolaris, OS/2 Warp, QNX, Oracle Solaris, Symbian, SunOS, SCO OpenServer, SCO UnixWare, Sanos and Tru64. A port of MySQL to OpenVMS also exists.[18]\nThe MySQL server software itself and the client libraries use dual-licensing distribution. They are offered under GPL version 2,[19] beginning from 28 June 2000[20] (which in 2009 has been extended with a FLOSS License Exception)[21] or to use a proprietary license.[22]\nSupport can be obtained from the official manual.[23] Free support additionally is available in different IRC channels and forums. Oracle offers paid support via its MySQL Enterprise products. They differ in the scope of services and in price. Additionally, a number of third party organisations exist to provide support and services, including MariaDB and Percona.\nMySQL has received positive reviews, and reviewers noticed it performs extremely well in the average case. and that the developer interfaces are there, and the documentation (not to mention feedback in the real world via Web sites and the like) is very, very good.[24] It has also been tested to be a fast, stable and true multi-user, multi-threaded sql database server.[25]"

			"Title": "History",
			"Content": "MySQL was created by a Swedish company, MySQL AB, founded by David Axmark, Allan Larsson and Michael Monty Widenius. The first version of MySQL appeared on 23 May 1995. It was initially created for personal usage from mSQL based on the low-level language ISAM, which the creators considered too slow and inflexible. They created a new SQL interface, while keeping the same API as mSQL. By keeping the API consistent with the mSQL system, many developers were able to use MySQL instead of the (proprietarily licensed) mSQL antecedent.[citation needed][dubious â€“ discuss]"
