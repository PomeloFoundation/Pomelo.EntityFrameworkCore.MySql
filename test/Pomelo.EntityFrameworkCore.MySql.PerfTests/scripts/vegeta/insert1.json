			"Content": "MySQL is written in C and C++. Its SQL parser is written in yacc, but it uses a home-brewed lexical analyzer.[17] MySQL works on many system platforms, including AIX, BSDi, FreeBSD, HP-UX, eComStation, i5/OS, IRIX, Linux, OS X, Microsoft Windows, NetBSD, Novell NetWare, OpenBSD, OpenSolaris, OS/2 Warp, QNX, Oracle Solaris, Symbian, SunOS, SCO OpenServer, SCO UnixWare, Sanos and Tru64. A port of MySQL to OpenVMS also exists.[18]\nThe MySQL server software itself and the client libraries use dual-licensing distribution. They are offered under GPL version 2,[19] beginning from 28 June 2000[20] (which in 2009 has been extended with a FLOSS License Exception)[21] or to use a proprietary license.[22]\nSupport can be obtained from the official manual.[23] Free support additionally is available in different IRC channels and forums. Oracle offers paid support via its MySQL Enterprise products. They differ in the scope of services and in price. Additionally, a number of third party organisations exist to provide support and services, including MariaDB and Percona.\nMySQL has received positive reviews, and reviewers noticed it performs extremely well in the average case. and that the developer interfaces are there, and the documentation (not to mention feedback in the real world via Web sites and the like) is very, very good.[24] It has also been tested to be a fast, stable and true multi-user, multi-threaded sql database server.[25]"

			"Content": "The first version of Entity Framework (EFv1) was included with .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 and Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1, released on 11 August 2008. This version was widely criticized, even attracting a 'vote of no confidence' signed by approximately one thousand developers.[3]\nThe second version of Entity Framework, named Entity Framework 4.0 (EFv4), was released as part of .NET 4.0 on 12 April 2010 and addressed many of the criticisms made of version 1.[4]\nA third version of Entity Framework, version 4.1, was released on April 12, 2011, with Code First support.\nA refresh of version 4.1, named Entity Framework 4.1 Update 1, was released on July 25, 2011. It includes bug fixes and new supported types.\nThe version 4.3.1 was released on February 29, 2012.[5] There were a few updates, like support for migration.\nVersion 5.0.0 was released on August 11, 2012[6] and is targeted at .NET framework 4.5. Also, this version is available for .Net framework 4, but without any runtime advantages over version 4.\nVersion 6.0 was released on October 17, 2013[7] and is now an open source project licensed under Apache License v2. Like ASP.NET MVC, its source code is hosted at CodePlex using Git.[8] This version has a number of improvements for code-first support.[9]\nVersion 7 (EF7) is currently being built as part of Microsoft's efforts to modernize, componentize and bring .NET cross-platform to Linux, OSX and elsewhere.[10] EF7 has been renamed to Entity Framework Core 1 (EF Core 1.0).[11] EF Core 1.0 was released alongside ASP.NET Core 1.0 on June 27, 2016.[12] EF Core 1.0 is licensed under Apache License v2, and is being built entirely in the open on GitHub. While EF Core 1.0 shares some conceptual similarities with prior versions of Entity Framework, it is a completely new codebase designed to be more efficient, powerful, flexible, and extensible, will run on Windows, Linux and OSX, and will support a new range of relational and NOSQL data stores.[10]"
